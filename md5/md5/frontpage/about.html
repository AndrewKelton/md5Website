        I am a student at the University of Central Florida pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Secure Computing and Networks.
        My passion lies in cybersecurity, writing code, continuous learning, and ethical hacking. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the intricacies 
        of technology and its impact on the world. This fascination led me to pursue a career in computer science, where I aim to contribute to innovative 
        solutions that address real-world challenges. Outside of academics, you can often find me exploring new programming languages, participating in 
        capture the flag (CTF) competitions, or engaging in cybersecurity research projects. I thrive in environments that foster creativity, critical 
        thinking, and collaboration. I believe in the importance of lifelong learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology. 
        My goal is to make a positive impact in the field of cybersecurity and contribute to building a more secure digital future.
